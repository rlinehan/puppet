V1 API Services
---------------

The V1 API has been removed. All previous routes can now be found under the
[Master V3](#Master-V3-HTTP-API) API or the [CA V1](#CA-V1-HTTP-API).

V2 HTTP API
-----------
The V2 API has been removed. All previous routes can now be found under the
[Master V3](#V3-HTTP-API).

Master and CA APIs
------------------

Beginning with Puppet 4, puppet's HTTP API has been split into two separate
APIs which are versioned separately. There is now one API for the master and
one for the certificate authority (CA).

All master endpoints are prefixed with `/puppet`, while all CA endpoints are
prefixed with `/puppet-ca`. All endpoints are explicitly versioned.

Authorization for these endpoints is still controlled with the `auth.conf`
authorization system in puppet. When specifying the authorization in
`auth.conf` the prefix (either `/puppet` or `/puppet-ca`) and the version
mumber on the paths must be retained; the full request path is used.

Master V3 HTTP API
------------------

Puppet Agents use various network services which the Puppet Master provides in
order to manage systems. Other systems can access these services in order to
put the information that the Puppet Master has to use.

The V3 API contains endpoints of two types: those based off of dispatching to
puppet's internal "indirector" framework and those that are not (namely the
[environments endpoint](#Environments-Endpoint)).

Every HTTP endpoint that dispatches to the indirector follows the form:
`/puppet/v3/:indirection/:key?environent=:environment` where

  * `:environment` is the name of the environment that should be in effect for
    the request. Not all endpoints need an environment, but the path component
    must always be specified.
  * `:indirection` is the indirection to dispatch the request to.
  * `:key` is the "key" portion of the indirection call.

Using this API requires a significant amount of understanding of how puppet's
internal services are structured. The following documents provide some
specification for what is available and the ways in which they can be
interacted with.

### Configuration Management Services

These services are all related to how the Puppet Agent is able to manage the
configuration of a node.

* {file:api/docs/http_catalog.md Catalog}
* {file:api/docs/http_file_bucket_file.md File Bucket File}
* {file:api/docs/http_file_content.md File Content}
* {file:api/docs/http_file_metadata.md File Metadata}
* {file:api/docs/http_report.md Report}

### Informational Services

These services all provide extra information that can be used to understand how
the Puppet Master will be providing configuration management information to
Puppet Agents.

* {file:api/docs/http_node.md Node}
* {file:api/docs/http_resource_type.md Resource Type}
* {file:api/docs/http_status.md Status}

### Environments Endpoint

The one endpoint with a different format is the `/puppet/v3/environments`
endpoint.

This endpoint will only accept payloads formatted as JSON and respond with JSON
(MIME application/json).

* {file:api/docs/http_environments.md Environments}

#### Error Responses

The `environments` endpoint will respond to error conditions in a uniform manner and
use standard HTTP response code to signify those errors.

* When the client submits a malformed request, the API will return a 400 Bad
  Request response.
* When the client is not authorized, the API will return a 403 Not Authorized
  response.
* When the client attempts to use an HTTP method that is not permissible for
  the endpoint, the API will return a 405 Method Not Allowed response.
* When the client asks for a response in a format other than JSON, the API will
  return a 406 Unacceptable response.
* When the server encounters an unexpected error during the handling of a
  request, it will return a 500 Server Error response.
* When the server is unable to find an endpoint handler for the request that
  starts with `/v2.0`, it will return a 404 Not Found response

All error responses will contain a body, except when it is a HEAD request. The
error responses will uniformly be a JSON object with the following properties:

  * `message`: [String] A human readable message explaining the error.
  * `issue_kind`: [String] A unique label to identify the error class.
  * `stacktrace` (only for 5xx errors): [Array<String>] A stacktrace to where the error occurred.

A {file:api/schemas/error.json JSON schema for the error objects} is also available.

CA V1 HTTP API
--------------

The CA API contains all of the endpoints used in support of Puppet's PKI
system.

The CA V1 endpoints share the same basic format as the Master V3 API, since
they are also based off of puppet's internal "indirector". However, they have
a different prefix and version. The endpoints thus follow the form:
`/puppet-ca/v1/:indirection/:key?environent=:environment` where

  * `:environment` is the name of the environment that should be in effect for
    the request. Not all endpoints need an environment, but the path component
    must always be specified.
  * `:indirection` is the indirection to dispatch the request to.
  * `:key` is the "key" portion of the indirection call.

As with the Master V3 API, using this API requires a significant amount of
understanding of how puppet's internal services are structured. The following
documents provide additional specification.

### SSL Certificate Related Services

* {file:api/docs/http_certificate.md Certificate}
* {file:api/docs/http_certificate_request.md Certificate Signing Requests}
* {file:api/docs/http_certificate_status.md Certificate Status}
* {file:api/docs/http_certificate_revocation_list.md Certificate Revocation List}

Serialization Formats
---------------------

Puppet sends messages using several different serialization formats. Not all
REST services support all of the formats.

* {file:api/docs/pson.md PSON}
* {http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html YAML}
